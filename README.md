Escher's Tiles

First have a look on the pdf-files.  
Do your like them?

Read 'EscherTiles.html'.  

I would have liked to offer a Pharo Smalltalk image but its size is 70MB.  
And github restricts the file size to 25MB.  

So what do you have to do to get the app running?  
+ install Pharo Smalltalk (Version 11, 64 Bit)
+ start Pharo Smalltalk with a fresh image
+ install Roassal3 and Roassal3Exporters from https://github.com/ObjectProfile/Roassal3
+ via the file browser filein 'Pedro1.st' (that's the source code)
+ in the Transcript do 'ETileApp run'
